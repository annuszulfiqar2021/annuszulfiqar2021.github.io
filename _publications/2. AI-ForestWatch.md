title: "2. AI-ForestWatch: Semantic Segmentation Based End-to-End Framework for Forest Estimation and Change Detection using Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing Imagery"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/AI-ForestWatch
excerpt: 'First forest cover change analysis based on deep learning has been performed over Pakistani regions in KP province with special interest in Billion Tree Tsunami afforestation project areas. Satellite data from Landsat-8 was labelled through digitization of local paper printed land cover maps taken as reference annotations for binary classification of forest and non-forest pixels at 25 meters per pixel resolution. Analysis was performed from 2013 to 2018 using a custom multispectral UNet architecture and pixel differencing techniques and results reveal an average forest cover increase of 39\% in five years (compared to previous forest cover percentage). Comparison of our results with JAXA ALOS PALSAR maps reveals similar trends from 2015 to 2017.'
