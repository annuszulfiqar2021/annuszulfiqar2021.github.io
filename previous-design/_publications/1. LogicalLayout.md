collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Logical-Layout-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning
excerpt: 'A strategy for logical layout analysis of front pages of medical publications was devised to identify fields of interest such as author names and affiliations. A layout independant approach was presented using LSTM architectures and GloVe vectors for word embeddings and our method outperformed the previous best results on this dataset on unseen layouts.'
